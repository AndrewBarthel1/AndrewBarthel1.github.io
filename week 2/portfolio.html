        <h1> Hi, I'm Andrew!</h1>
        <p>I'm a junior in CTD with a minor in Music </p>

    <div id="about">
        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>What does it mean to be Andrew? It means to ask what's next. I always put my best foot forward and ask what more I can do.
            It means to treat people with kindness and inquizativeness. It means to be a leader, but also a listener. I come from Hartland, Wisconsin,
            and so I'm filled with plenty of Hart. I've been taught competativeness, but also collabrativeness. I strive for the top, but I belive that we should all be there.
            If you really want to know what it means to be Andrew: ask!

        <h2> Intrests</h2>
        <h3> Hobbies</h3>
            <ul>Climbing</ul>
               <p>Climbing has been a huge part of my life for about 12 years. I competed on Adventure Rock Climbing Team
               and found some of my greatest friends there. I was team captain and I made nationals many times!
               Now, I compete for CU Climbing Team, and I've taken 7th at nationals, along with become a part of its
               thriving community. I also love to outdoor climb, and it's shown me some of the most amazing places, and
               taught me how to struggle.</p>
            <ul>Music</ul>
            <p>Music is an intregral passion to me, and I believe is the seasoning that makes life taste good.
                I grew up drumming, and drumming is very fun, but I've found piano to be more rewarding. I also have expirance 
                with guitar and harmonica. I always want to learn more, and I think it's very vauluable to learn a lot of different intstruments
                as they teach different tambres and tones. I played in a band in highschool for gigs around my local area, and it's taught me teamwork.
                Especially as a drummer, you can't play alone, so music teaches me how to preform with others.
            </p>
            <ul>Motorcycles</ul>
            <p>
                Motorcycles are a pretty recent thing for me. I started out with a moped, decided it wasn't enough, and 
                upgraded to a Suzuki V-Strom 650. Bikes have taught me some integral skills about driving, as well as mechanic
                skills. I bought it used, so I have to upkeep it often to make sure things run smooth. Problem solving, patience,
                reaction time - these things are nessesary for bike ownership. I plan to add many upgrades, so my skills 
                will continue to grow!
            </p>
        <h3> Academic</h3>
            <ul>Coding</ul>
            <p>
                I started coding in middle school with block coding systems, making games and anamations for myself and friends.
                These skills paid off when I switched to real coding, which is much like learning a new language. There are rules,
                and many unintuative concepts which force me to change my mentalities. I created snake last year for my data science course,
                and it was really useful to see how simple one can make a game just by using linked lists and loops. 
            </p>
            <ul>Crafting</ul>
            <p>
                Crafting encompases all sorts of concepts, but wood and metalworking are the main ones I've focused on.
                Woodworking started for me in middleschool, when I would make swords for a game me and a friend were making.
                It was shocking how much I could make with just a simple jigsaw, and it's taught me the precision nessesary for more intense
                woodworking. A single cut can destroy the shape of the sword, or the blade one works with. I continue this with my
                Material Studies and Practice course, where I will hopefully be able to make instruments, whcih has been a dream of mine for a long time now!
            </p>
            <ul>Jazz</ul>
            <p>
                Jazz has been present in my life also since middleschool, and it takes standard music concepts and filps them on their head.
                Improving has likley been the most important skill I've learned so far. It's like a conversation; a single moment cannot be regained.
                Timing, tone, language, are all present in jazz, and it's expression can be deep and emotional, or light, and even funny! I belive everyone
                should learn an instrument, as it really shows what can be convayed without words.
            </p>

    <div id="goals">
        <h2> Goals</h2>
        <h3>Band in a Box</h3>
        <p>Music with friends can be hard. Many don't have an instrument, and most cannot play well enough to jam. The band in a bos fixes this problem!
            The plan is to take a suitcase-sized box, and layer instruments, a drum machine, metronome, chord machine, and mash them together.
            This box would have varieying levels of skills required, having a 2 octave keyboard, flute tuned to c, and the previous mentioned machines.
            All of this would also link to a midi output, so you can save your work and listen to what you and your buddies put together.
            Music is something everyone should be able to do, and the band in a box will let people "do"!
