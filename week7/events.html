            Colorado 14ers get all the glory, but what about the peaks just shy of that improbable height?
            There are hundreds of 13ers, many with incredible quality and untapped potential. We will be riding
            to the Fourth of July trailhead and doing the Arapahoe traverse. Bring a bike that can handle fire roads and rocks,
            and we'll see you there!

        </p><p class="hidden after">Colorado is a place of immaculate nature, and keeping it clean is how 
            we let everyone else enjoy it too. Sustainability is a big part of keeping dangerous parts and bad chemicals
            out of nature, which comes in the form of reusing parts. Come to Fort Collins to trade your used gear to people
            who could use it more!

        </p><p class="hidden after">Driving on dirt roads with wind on your face and mud in the air is one of lifes
             greatest pleasures, but it takes a lot of work to have that fun afternoon with some buddies. Roads have to be maintained,
             and 70% of maintainence comes from volenteers. Join the 70% club and earn free 70% stickers, make friends, and get vouchers

            Want to get $1000 off your insurance every year? Click to learn more!
        </p><p class="hidden after">Motorcyling is an inherently dangerous activity, and many more drivers
            die per capita than car drivers each year. Safty is integral to riding in a long life, and skills can dwindle over the years.
            Weather your a new rider on a 175 dirt bike, or a old-fashioned harley hero on a 1750 tourer, a safty course
            can help you improve your skills. Insurance companies also are more inclined to give disounts to safe drivers,
            so the course can pay dividends!

        </p><p class="hidden after">Do you remember that movie Tron? With the light racers? We decided that movie is awesome!
