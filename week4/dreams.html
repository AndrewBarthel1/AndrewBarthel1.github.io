        <h2>Band in a Box</h2>
        <p>Music with friends can be hard. Many don't have an instrument, and most cannot play well enough to jam. The band in a bos fixes this problem!
            The plan is to take a suitcase-sized box, and layer instruments, a drum machine, metronome, chord machine, and mash them together.
            This box would have varieying levels of skills required, having a 2 octave keyboard, flute tuned to c, and the previous mentioned machines.
            All of this would also link to a midi output, so you can save your work and listen to what you and your buddies put together.
            Music is something everyone should be able to do, and the band in a box will let people "do"!</p>
            <h2>Treehouse</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I always looked up to my grandpa. He was always tinkering, the life of the party,
            and loved his grandchildren more than anything. When I was 8, he started constructing a Treehouse
            at our cabin in northern Wisconsin. That same year, he would suffer a stroke and be wheelchair bound until his death.
            The treehouse lay untouched and unfinished for years, and as I got older, I realized I wanted to continue his legacy and finish it for him.
            I plan to spend the summer after graduation finishing his project. This will be both a personal project, and a great
            boost to my skillset.
        </p>
        <h2>Album</h2>
        <p>An album is the ultimate proof of skill for any musician. It's a process in storytelling, in production, in music theory,
            and in passion. By graduation, I will like to have an album released and hopefully it will propel my music
            career and let me work with great musicians!
