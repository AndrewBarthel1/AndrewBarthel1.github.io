    <h2>
        Climbing
    </h2>
    <p>
        Climbing has been a huge part of my life for about 12 years. I competed on Adventure Rock Climbing Team
               and found some of my greatest friends there. I was team captain and I made nationals many times!
               Now, I compete for CU Climbing Team, and I've taken 7th at nationals, along with become a part of its
               thriving community. I also love to outdoor climb, and it's shown me some of the most amazing places, and
               taught me how to struggle.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Music
    </h2>
    <p>
        Music is an intregral passion to me, and I believe is the seasoning that makes life taste good.
                I grew up drumming, and drumming is very fun, but I've found piano to be more rewarding. I also have expirance 
                with guitar and harmonica. I always want to learn more, and I think it's very vauluable to learn a lot of different intstruments
                as they teach different tambres and tones. I played in a band in highschool for gigs around my local area, and it's taught me teamwork.
                Especially as a drummer, you can't play alone, so music teaches me how to preform with others.

    <h2>
        Mountaineering
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mountaineering is a recent passion that comes from childhood dreams. As a kid, I loved to watch videos
        and read books about great mountainteering adventures. This motivated me to come out west to pursue this 
        passion and climb many of colorados 14ers, as well as pursue alpine climbing on Yosemite's big walls, as well
        as the Diamond on Longs Peak. I am now looking to mountains such as the Grand Teton to continue my journey. Mountaineering
        has taught me that hard work results in amazing things, and the views from the top of mountains have given
        me a more whole perspective on what is important in this world, and how important it is to protect those things.
    </p>
    <h2>Motorcycles</h2>
    <p>
        Motorcycles are a pretty recent thing for me. I started out with a moped, decided it wasn't enough, and 
        upgraded to a Suzuki V-Strom 650. Bikes have taught me some integral skills about driving, as well as mechanic
        skills. I bought it used, so I have to upkeep it often to make sure things run smooth. Problem solving, patience,
        reaction time - these things are nessesary for bike ownership. I plan to add many upgrades, so my skills 
        will continue to grow!
